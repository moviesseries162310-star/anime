    "description": "Flum wasn't chosen for her strength—she has none. No magic, no skill, only an ability called “Reversal” that even she doesn't understand. So why did God place her in the hero's party? After being betrayed and sold into slavery, Flum is abused and eventually thrown to monsters for entertainment. Now faced with death, Flum must choose: be devoured or take up a cursed sword said to kill its wielder.",
