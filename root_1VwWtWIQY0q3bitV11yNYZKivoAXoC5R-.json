    "description": "Brandon and Royal are among a small group of firefighters in California who were trained while incarcerated and managed to break through and become professional firefighters post-release, but that’s not the story for most of their peers. After securing their own careers, they decided to take matters into their own hands and start their own nonprofit and fire department. Firebreak follows Brandon, Royal and their third group of trainees as they make their way through Brandon and Royal’s tough training program.",
